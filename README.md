## Overview
***
[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a site with relevant news, jobs, stories, polls that users can create and comment on.

This challenge consists on creating a reader app made with Next.js/React that consumes HackerNews content from a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) microservice running on [Dapr](https://dapr.io/).

HackerNews provides a [public API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) that you can examine in order to build this challenge.


## Objective
***
For this challenge you will build a single page application using React and Next.js. You can build your UI based on this partial prototype:

This is only a suggestion but feel free to unleash your creativity and create your own UI/UX design ðŸš€ðŸš€. 

## Instructions

* Create a public GitHub repository to host the project codebase. You will share that repo with us.
* Install Dapr locally as a self-hosted dev environment. The Dapr runtime should make use of the [GraphQL binding](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/graghql/).
* Make sure to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Evaluation Criteria
* Completeness: did you complete all the features?
* Correctness: does the functionality behave in sensible, thought-out ways?
* Maintainability: is the code it written in a clean, maintainable way?
* Testing: is the system adequately tested?
* Documentation: is the Web Application well-documented?

## Tips
Layout your code in a well structured way. Think of this project as if it was going to be published in production. Do your commits in a way that show well separated additions of fucntionality. 

**All the best and happy coding,**
